An adaptable, fast and flexible window manager for various platforms - and
configured with GNU Guile!

# Description

This is an experiment in window managers, where the same language - GNU Guile! - is used to configure it - with a standardised gRPC interface for control.

It [will] comes with an out of the box configuration, and users are encouraged to tinker to their heart's desire! Control is done via the `rawrctl` executable, which [will] run on Windows, Linux, \*BSD, and macOS.

RawrWM is based around 'backends'. The idea is to have a unifying API exposed by Guile, and to be able to use the same configuration acrsos platforms. This includes Microsoft Windows 10/11 (previous versions will *not* be supported), and recent-ish macOS/Linux/\*BSD (TBC).

It's heavily a work in progress, but integration is expected with [automon][automon], another project of mine, and [guile-rs][guile-rs].
